## About

The `anonpy` module makes it easier to communicate with REST APIs for anonymously
uploading and downloading files. It implements an extensible provider-independent
class system and also comes with an intuitive CLI or lightweight GUI for interactive
usage.

Documentation for this project is located on the GitHub
[Wiki](https://github.com/Advanced-Systems/anonpy/wiki)
page.

## Installation

`anonpy` is available on PyPI:

```powershell
pip install anonpy
```

Release candidates (preview versions) of this library can be installed with:

```powershell
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ anonpy
```

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for running `anonpy`'s CLI, it is
recommended to install it with the [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) command.

```powershell
pipx install anonpy
```

## Library

`anonpy` can be used to interface with a wide variety of REST services by
building a contract with the `Endpoint` class.

```python
from anonpy import AnonPy, Endpoint

api = "https://pixeldrain.com/api/"
endpoint = Endpoint(upload="/file", download="file/{}", preview="/file/{}/info")

anon = AnonPy(api, endpoint)

# retrieve resource meta data without committing to a download
preview = anon.preview("LNcXZ9UM")
print(f"{preview=}")

# download a resource to the current working directory
download = anon.download("LNcXZ9UM", progressbar=True)
print(f"{download=}")

# upload a file
upload = anon.upload("homework.docx", progressbar=True)
print(f"{upload=}")
```

## Command Line Interface

Read the help manual:

```powershell
anonpy --help
```

## Graphical User Interface

> âš  This feature is currently not implemented yet, but is expected to be released
> in version 1.2.0

Launch a graphical user interface for uploading and downloading files:

```powershell
anonpy --gui
```

## Acknowledgements

Historically speaking, this module can be considered a continuation of the
[`anonfile-api`](https://github.com/nstrydom2/anonfile-api/) project, although
any resemblance of compatibility may only be temporary. On 16 August 2023, the
anonymous file sharing website <https://anonfiles.com> shut down due to overwhelming
abuse by the community, which was the driving factor for creating a backend-agnostic
library that can stand the test of time. That's why to this day, `anonpy` still
uses the anonfiles logo as a small nod to its past.

Special thanks to [@aaronlyy](https://github.com/aaronlyy) for passing on the
PyPI name [`anonpy`](https://pypi.org/project/anonpy/) to [@StefanGreve](https://github.com/aaronlyy).
